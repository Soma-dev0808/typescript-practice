# typescript-practice

## Created project from scrach.

- Use webpack and babel for bundling and compiling code.
    - Babel is used to compile typescript code into compatible js code and typescript won't compile code in the webpack process for this project.
    - Typescript is only used for type-checking purpose.
    - Eslint is used in Webpack process and locally coding.
